Continuous tensor: 

NIPS.RData, rNIPS.RData : NIPS words count data. It shows information about papers published in NIPS from 1987 to 2003, collected by Globerson et al.


Binary tensor:

Preferable: 
one continuous + one binary; 
one on medical science (e.g. brain MFI) + one on social science (e.g. social networks)
avoid time-series data
Roughly balanced in three modes. Not sure whether we can handle tensors up to d=1K
modern data (>2015); 


brain_binary_IQ.RData (preferred): brain connectivity data (no response). Not used yet. 

airline_select_data.RData: used in my collaborative paper with Anru. Details in https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09996

bbnet68_spatial_orientation.RData (neutral): brain connectivity data (no response). supervised version used in matrix regression paper. Unsupervised version has not been used yet. 

alyawarradata.mat (not preferred): kinship data. same data used in my JMLR paper

dnations.mat (not preferred): nations political data. Same data used in my JMLR paper. Supervised version has been used in my tensor regression paper.
